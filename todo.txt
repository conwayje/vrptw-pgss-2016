- Initial solution
- - Nearest neighbor
- - Dijkstra
- - Note: Both should use distance matrix

- Clear queue if no progress
- Bigger move types
- Get distance optimization acutally working
- Heuristic scoring
- - Include all attributes that we want
- Additional moves
- - Include anything that we think is clever / useful
- Paper & Slides
- Ambiguous with respect to # of trucks
- Look for any @TODO markers and fix as needed
- Use clusters somewhere
- add cleverness to cluster move
- case move choices and child numbers on situation in AStar / etc.
- use deque
- detect path/path intersections; store information about them based on path number or truck number (?)
- make move to specifically fix intersections
- up the penalty on intersections
- focus more on close moves
- catch keyboard interrupts?????
